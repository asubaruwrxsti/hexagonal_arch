## [Hexagonal Architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hexagonal-architecture-system-design/)

Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) for your microservices. It's particularly well-suited for microservices because it:

Clearly separates your business logic from external concerns
Makes your services more testable and maintainable
Allows you to change external dependencies without affecting core functionality

Here's how you could structure each microservice:
```gherkin=!
Feature: Service Architecture Structure

  Background:
    Given a service named "service_name"

  Scenario: Core domain organization
    When I navigate to the "/core" directory
    Then I should find the following subdirectories:
      | domain    | For business entities and value objects       |
      | use_cases | For application logic and business rules      |
      | ports     | For interfaces defining core interactions     |

  Scenario: Ports organization
    When I navigate to the "/core/ports" directory
    Then I should find the following subdirectories:
      | incoming | For API contracts                             |
      | outgoing | For repository and external service interfaces |

  Scenario: Adapters organization
    When I navigate to the "/adapters" directory
    Then I should find the following subdirectories:
      | incoming | For HTTP controllers and message consumers    |
      | outgoing | For DB repositories and external API clients  |

  Scenario: Configuration and entry points
    Then I should find the following at the root level:
      | config     | For configuration                            |
      | main.py    | Application entry point                      |
      | Dockerfile | Container definition                         |
```

### Hexagonal Architecture Sequence Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant IncomingAdapter as Incoming Adapter
   participant ApplicationCore as Application Core
   participant OutgoingAdapter as Outgoing Adapter
   participant ExternalSystem as External System

   Client->>IncomingAdapter: Request
   IncomingAdapter->>ApplicationCore: Translate & forward request
   ApplicationCore->>OutgoingAdapter: Request external data/services
   OutgoingAdapter->>ExternalSystem: Communicate with external system
   ExternalSystem-->>OutgoingAdapter: Response
   OutgoingAdapter-->>ApplicationCore: Translate & return data
   ApplicationCore-->>IncomingAdapter: Process & return result
   IncomingAdapter-->>Client: Format & deliver response
```

This architecture forces you to think about your domain model first and keeps your business logic completely isolated from HTTP, database, or other infrastructure concerns.
The key benefit is that your business logic doesn't depend on Flask, databases, or other external systems - they become replaceable "adapters" around your core domain. This makes your services more resilient to change and easier to test.
It has a steeper learning curve but provides more long-term benefits for complex applications, especially in a microservices context.

### Current Implementation

Core Components
Core Domain (src/core/domain/)

Contains business entities and logic
Independent of external concerns
Pure business rules and domain models
Use Cases (src/core/use_cases/)

Application-specific business rules
Orchestrates the flow of data
Implements business operations
Ports (src/core/ports/)

Defines interfaces for:
Incoming (API contracts)
Outgoing (repository/external service interfaces)
Adapters (src/adapters/)

Incoming: HTTP controllers, API endpoints
Outgoing: Database repositories, external API clients

#### Flow of Control
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>Incoming Adapter: HTTP Request
    Incoming Adapter->>Application Core: Convert to domain model
    Application Core->>Outgoing Adapter: Request data
    Outgoing Adapter->>External System: DB/API call
    External System-->>Outgoing Adapter: Raw data
    Outgoing Adapter-->>Application Core: Domain objects
    Application Core-->>Incoming Adapter: Result
    Incoming Adapter-->>Client: HTTP Response
```

The key benefit is that the business logic in the core domain remains isolated from external dependencies like FastAPI, databases, or other systems. 

Tests can be found in tests and the application entry point is main.py.
